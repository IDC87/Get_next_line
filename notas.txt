/* ^M Char explanation:
Unix uses 0xA for a newline character. 
Windows uses a combination of two characters: 0xD 0xA. 0xD is the carriage return character. 
^M happens to be the way vim displays 0xD (0x0D = 13, M is the 13th letter in the English alphabet).

You can remove all the ^M characters by running the following:

:%s/^M//g

Where ^M is entered by holding down Ctrl and typing v followed by m, and then releasing Ctrl. 
This is sometimes abbreviated as ^V^M, but note that you must enter it as described in the previous sentence, 
rather than typing it out literally.
This expression will replace all occurrences of ^M with the empty string (i.e. nothing). 
I use this to get rid of ^M in files copied from Windows to Unix (Solaris, Linux, OSX).
